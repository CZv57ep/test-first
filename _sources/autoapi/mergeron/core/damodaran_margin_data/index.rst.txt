.. py:module:: mergeron.core.damodaran_margin_data

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Functions to parse margin data compiled by
   Prof. Aswath Damodaran, Stern School of Business, NYU.

   Data are downloaded or reused from a local copy, on demand.

   For terms of use of Prof. Damodaran's data, please see:

   .. rubric:: Notes

   Prof. Damodaran notes that the data construction may not be
   consistent from iteration to iteration. He also notes that,
   "the best use for my data is in real time corporate financial analysis
   and valuation." Here, gross margin data compiled by Prof. Damodaran are
   optionally used to model the distribution of price-cost margin
   across firms that antitrust enforcement agencies are likely to review in
   merger enforcement investigations over a multi-year span. The
   implicit assumption is that refinements in source-data construction from
   iteration to iteration do not result in inconsistent estimates of
   the empirical distribution of margins estimated using
   a Gaussian kernel density estimator (KDE).

   Second, other procedures included in this package allow the researcher to
   generate margins for a single firm and impute margins of other firms in
   a model relevant antitrust market based on FOCs for profit maximization by
   firms facing MNL demand. In that exercise, the distribution of
   inferred margins does not follow the empirical distribution estimated
   from the source data, due to restrictions resulting from the distribution of
   generated market shares across firms and the feasibility condition that
   price-cost margins fall in the interval :math:`[0, 1]`.

   Generate draws from the empirical distribution bassed on Prof. Damodaran's margin data.

   The empirical distribution is estimated using a Gaussian KDE; the bandwidth
   selected using Silverman's rule is narrowed to reflect that the margin data
   are multimodal. Margins for firms in finance, investment, insurance, reinsurance, and
   REITs are excluded from the sample used to estimate the empirical distribution.

   :param _sample_size: Number of draws
   :param seed_sequence: SeedSequence for seeding random-number generator when results
                         are to be repeatable

   :returns: Array of margin values
