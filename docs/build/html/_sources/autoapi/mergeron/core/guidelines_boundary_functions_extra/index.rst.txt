=================================================

.. py:module:: mergeron.core.guidelines_boundary_functions_extra

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Specialized methods for defining and analyzing boundaries for Guidelines standards.

   These methods (functions) provide rely on scipy of sympy for core computations,
   and may provide improved precision than core functions, but tend to have
   poor performance

.. py:function:: dh_area_quad(_dh_val = 0.01, /, *, prec = 9)

   Area under the ΔHHI boundary.

   When the given ΔHHI bound matches a Guidelines safeharbor,
   the area under the boundary is half the intrinsic clearance rate
   for the ΔHHI safeharbor.

   :param _dh_val: Merging-firms' ΔHHI bound.
   :param prec: Specified precision in decimal places.

   :returns: Area under ΔHHI boundary.


.. py:function:: hhi_delta_boundary_qdtr(_dh_val = 0.01, /)

   Generate the list of share combination on the ΔHHI boundary.

   :param _dh_val: Merging-firms' ΔHHI bound.

   :returns: Callable to generate array of share-pairs, area under boundary.


.. py:function:: shrratio_boundary_qdtr_wtd_avg(_delta_star = 0.075, _r_val = 0.85, /, *, weighting = 'own-share', recapture_form = 'inside-out')

   Share combinations for the share-weighted average GUPPI boundary with symmetric
   merging-firm margins.

   :param _delta_star: corollary to GUPPI bound (:math:`\overline{g} / (m^* \cdot \overline{r})`)
   :param _r_val: recapture ratio
   :param weighting: Whether "own-share" or "cross-product-share" (or None for simple, unweighted average)
   :param recapture_form: Whether recapture-ratio is MNL-consistent ("inside-out") or has fixed
                          value for both merging firms ("proportional").

   :returns: Array of share-pairs, area under boundary.


.. py:function:: shrratio_boundary_distance(_delta_star = 0.075, _r_val = 0.85, /, *, agg_method = 'arithmetic mean', weighting = 'own-share', recapture_form = 'inside-out', prec = 5)

   Share combinations for the GUPPI boundaries using various aggregators with
   symmetric merging-firm margins.

   Reimplements the arithmetic-averages and distance estimations from function,
   `shrratio_boundary_wtd_avg` but uses the Minkowski-distance function,
   `scipy.spatial.distance.minkowski` for all aggregators. This reimplementation
   is useful for testing the output of `shrratio_boundary_wtd_avg`
   but runs considerably slower.

   :param _delta_star: corollary to GUPPI bound (:math:`\overline{g} / (m^* \cdot \overline{r})`)
   :param _r_val: recapture ratio
   :param agg_method: Whether "arithmetic mean" or "distance".
   :param weighting: Whether "own-share" or "cross-product-share".
   :param recapture_form: Whether recapture-ratio is MNL-consistent ("inside-out") or has fixed
                          value for both merging firms ("proportional").
   :param prec: Number of decimal places for rounding returned shares and area.

   :returns: Array of share-pairs, area under boundary.
